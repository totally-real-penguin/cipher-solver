# Cipher Solver
### by TotallyRealPenguin

A project made in godot for me and my friends. It has solvers for some basic ciphers
It's intended use was to help my friends with the [Cipher Challenge](https://www.cipherchallenge.org/)
It's not very well designed but it works and thats all it needs to do
